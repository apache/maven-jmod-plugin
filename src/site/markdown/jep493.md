# JEP 493: Linking Run-Time Images without JMODs

Java 24 introduced ["JEP 493: Linking Run-Time Images without JMODs"](https://openjdk.org/jeps/493).
Goal of this JEP is to reduce JDK size by about 25%, by removing the JDK's own JMOD files.
This means that since Java 24 each JDK vendor decides if they support the new option or ship the JMOD files.
For example the [Eclipse Temurin JDK](https://adoptium.net/news/2025/08/eclipse-temurin-jdk24-JEP493-enabled) does not ship these files anymore since Java 24.

The Maven JMod Plugin depends on the existence of the `/jmods` folder of the used JDK (configured via `JAVA_HOME`) and will fail if this directory does not exist.
If you want to use the Maven JMod Plugin make sure to either use a JDK which still ships the JDK's own JMOD files natively or try to download them in addition to the JDK.

In the long term the JDK team suggest to link run-time images without JMODs as introduced in the JEP.
